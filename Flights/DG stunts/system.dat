24.75 NOTE All the scenarios in the 'Tutorials' and 'Playback' folders are pre-recorded flights. Try them out at your leisure.

88.26 NOTE The simulation then switches to active mode, and you are back in control.
99 NOTE A good strategy is to watch a tutorial first, and next time fly it yourself and try to repeat the mission.
110.812 CAMERA SET Cockpit:GL-01:30.00
110.82 NOTE At the end of a playback, the simulation always switches back to active mode.
125.35 CAMERA SET Ground:GL-01:10.00:Earth -80.65563 28.57655 3.07
125.35 NOTE You can also record your own flights. During a simulation session, press F5, or click 'Rec' on the Flight recorder dialog (Ctrl-F5) to start recording.
138.5 CAMERA SET Track:GL-01:30.00:GLOBAL 9.904 0.684 0.220
138.5 NOTE The recording ends when you press F5 again, press the 'STOP' button in the dialog box, or end the simulation.

206.93 CAMERA SET Track:GL-01:40.00:GLOBAL 7.049 2.001 0.427
206.93 NOTE This will open the editor window containing a list of recorded events (which may be empty at the start).
218 NOTE If you want to insert an event at some point during the playback, pause the simulation (Ctrl-P), select an event type from the pulldown list in the editor window, and press 'Insert'.
229.075 NOTE Next, edit any event parameters to your preferences.
239.089 CAMERA SET Track:GL-01:10.00:GLOBAL 54.207 -0.654 -0.575
244 CAMERA SET Ground:GL-01:10.00:Earth -80.69021 28.60638 7.00

256 NOTE You can take it for a spin yourself now (and maybe try the recorder). Make sure you don't overwrite any playbacks you want to keep!
