How to release new D3D9Client Versions (Builds)
===============================================

1. Abstract
   --------
     This document describes the steps that need to be performed when releasing
   a new version of D3D9Client.

     The intention of this document is to make sure that the release process is
   standardized and hopefully less failure prone by giving a step-by-step
   instruction manual.

2. Preparations
   ------------
     Currently (May 2015) we have to build --at least-- two release versions of
   the client, one for SpaceXpanse 2010-P1[*] and one for SpaceXpanse BETA[**]!

     Each release will be build and linked against different SpaceXpanse APIs and
   might therefore not be backwards rsp. upwards compatible.

     A basic understanding of subversion is needed to follow all the steps in
   chapter 3. Nothing too special, but terms like "commit", "create tag" and
   "working copy" should be familiar.

     For an overview of required tools to compile D3D9Client from the sources
   see the README.txt document located at the source path[***]. Note that for
   building a fully working release the NVIDIA API has to be installed on the
   build system as well!

   [*]   SpaceXpanse 2010-P1     : Build Jan 1 2013 [v.130101]
   [**]  SpaceXpanse BETA rev.13 : Build Mar 6 2015 [v.150306] (revision and build-
                               number of SpaceXpanse are just an example here)

3. Step by step instruction
   ------------------------
   3.1. Version Number increase.
          Make sure the repository contains sources with a new version number
        and derived files with that new version number.
        Version number have to be adjusted in the following files:
        - SpaceXpansesdk\D3D9Client\D3D9Client.cpp
        - SpaceXpansesdk\D3D9Client\doc\Doxyfile
        - Utils\D3D9Client\build_release.bat
        Derived files are:
        - Doc\D3D9Client.pdf
        - SpaceXpansesdk\D3D9Client\doc\D3D9Client_API_Reference.chm

        Changes due to a version number increase should therefore *only* affect
        the following files indicated by subversion modifications:
        - Doc\D3D9Client.pdf
        - SpaceXpansesdk\D3D9Client\D3D9Client.cpp
        - SpaceXpansesdk\D3D9Client\doc\D3D9Client_API_Reference.chm
        - SpaceXpansesdk\D3D9Client\doc\Doxyfile
        - Utils\D3D9Client\build_release.bat
        Make sure these modification have been committed!

   3.2. Create a tag.
          To be able to easily re-create any previous release, tags are created
        for any released version of D3D9Client. The naming of those tags follow
        this simple schema:

        * Tag names for SpaceXpanse BETA releases are named like 'Beta ##'
                                                (for example 'Beta 9')
        * Tag names for SpaceXpanse 2010-P1 releases are named like 'R##'
                                                   (for example 'R15')

        Attention! SpaceXpanse BETA tags are taken from the trunk, while
                   SpaceXpanse 2010-P1 tags are taken from '2010-P1' branch!

        When the according tag has been created one can build the release
        ZIP(s). This should be done on a working copy of the according tag.

   3.3. Decide what to build (2010-P1 or BETA release)
          The source code of the trunk and the '2010-P1' branch do not differ
        much, but those little differences make the point!

          Therefore when your working copy is from the trunk, you'll build a
        'BETA' release and when your working copy is from the '2010-P1' branch
        you'll build a 2010-P1 release. Simple, right ;)

          The best thing is to have two working copies of D3D9Client available
        that do have the according SpaceXpanse libraries & -header files as local
        files. These two folders (working copies) can than be updated and build
        whenever one likes to build a new D3D9 release.

          The SpaceXpanse libraries & -header files for a 2010-P1 release working-
        copy should never be changed, due to the fact that the 2010-P1 SpaceXpanse
        release is stable (frozen).
          The SpaceXpanse libraries & -header files for a BEAT release working-copy
        however might need to be replaced more frequently (whenever Martin S.
        updates the libraries or -header files in SpaceXpanses repository[*])

        --
        [*] For a build of D3D9Client, only the content of the folders
            'SpaceXpansesdk/include/' and 'SpaceXpansesdk/lib/' from the official
            spacexpanse repository ('svn://spacexpanse-forum.com/spacexpanse/') are needed.

   3.4. Run the build script[*] located in the 'Utils' folder.
          This should build a new release and create two new ZIP files named
        (for example) 'D3D9ClientBeta12-forRev13(r54321).zip' and
        'D3D9ClientBeta12-forRev13(r54321)+src.zip' when you build from trunk,
        or 'D3D9ClientR15-for2010-P1(r54321).zip' &
        'D3D9ClientR15-for2010-P1(r54321).zip' when you build from the
        '2010-P1' branch.
