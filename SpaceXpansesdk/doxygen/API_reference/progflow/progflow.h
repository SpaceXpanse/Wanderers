  This section defines the program flow of the SpaceXpanse frame loop and the order in which module callback
  functions are called by SpaceXpanse.

  \section fameupd Frame update diagram
  The program flow diagram below illustrates the events in the SpaceXpanse frame update loop and the calling order
  of VESSEL2 callback functions.
  The clbkPreStep and clbkPostStep methods are called for every vessel at each frame update. Other callback
  functions are only called when the associated event has occurred. Some callback functions such as
  clbkPanelRedrawEvent may be called multiple times for a vessel in a single frame.
