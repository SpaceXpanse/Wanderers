# SpaceXpanse integration and unit tests

## Unit tests

Unit tests are written as .cpp files in this directory and registered using `add_test_file` CMake function. Naming convention is "Module.Test.cpp"

Unit tests have a default timeout of 30 seconds for whole suite

## Integration tests

Integration tests are implemented by

1. Adding a Lua script to Script\Tests directory
1. Adding a corresponding scenario referencing this script to Scenarios\Tests directory

Lua script must:

1. Ensure test runs for limited time (under 60 seconds)
1. Call oapi.exit(code) when test is finished, pass non-zero return code in case of failed test, and 0 - if all tests are successful
1. Print information about execution using oapi.write_log
