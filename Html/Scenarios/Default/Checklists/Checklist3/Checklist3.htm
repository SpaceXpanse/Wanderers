<h1>Mission 3: De-orbit from Mir</h1>
<p>
This mission completes your orbital roundtrip with a re-entry to return to Kennedy Space Center.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Start SpaceXpanse with the <i>Checklists|Deorbit</i> scenario. This picks up where the previous mission ended, with the glider docked to the Mir station. You are currently over the Pacific ocean, already in the correct location for the deorbit burn.
<li>Undock ( <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> ), and engage retros for a few seconds ( <kbd>-</kbd><sub><i>Numpad</i></sub> ) to get clear of the station.
<li>Close the nose cone ( <kbd>K</kbd> ).
<li>Turn retrograde ( <kbd>]</kbd> ).
<li>When the glider's attitude has stabilised and the retrograde direction is no longer obstructed by the station, engage main engines at 100%.
<li>Kill engines when the perigee radius (PeR in Orbit MFD) has decreased to 5.600M.
<li>Turn prograde ( <kbd>[</kbd> ).
<li>When attitude has stabilised, roll the glider level with the horizon ( <kbd>L</kbd> ).
<li>Switch to Surface HUD mode ( <kbd>H</kbd> ).
<li>Turn left MFD into surface mode (<i>SEL</i>, <i>Surface</i>).
<li>You should reach 100km altitude about 4000km from the target (Dst: 4.000M in Map MFD). At this point, aerodynamic forces will become noticeable.
<li>At 50km altitude, turn off attitude stabilisation ( <kbd>L</kbd> ), disable RCS ( <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd><sub><i>Numpad</i></sub> ), and make sure that "AF CTRL" is set to "ON".
<li>Lift forces will cause the glider to pitch up. To bleed off energy you should perform left and right banks. Due to the relatively high lift/drag ratio of the glider you need very steep bank angles (90&deg;).
<li>Your current flight path passes south of the KSC, so you should initially bank left to correct your approach path (check Map MFD).
<li>The bank angle will determine your rate of descent and airspeed. If you come up short to the KSC, reduce the bank angles to slow your descent and reduce atmospheric deceleration. If you come in too fast or too high, increase the bank angles to increase the descent slope and atmospheric friction.
<li>Timing of the reentry path is not quite as critical as for the Space Shuttle, because the glider can use its engines for a powered approach.
<li>When the distance to target drops below 500km, tune your NAV1 receiver to frequency 112.70 (KSCX VOR), and NAV2 to frequency 134.20 (Rwy 33 ILS) using the COMMS mode (<i>SEL</i>, <i>COM/NAV</i>) in the right MFD.
<li>Turn the right MFD to Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) mode (<i>SEL</i>, <i>HSI</i>). Leave the left display slaved to NAV1, and flip the right display to NAV2 (Right-<kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd>, Right-<kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd> ).
<li>Use the course deviation and glide slope indicators of the HSI displays for adjusting the approach path. They work like standard aircraft instruments.
<li>Lower landing gear ( <kbd>G</kbd> ). Deploy airbrakes ( <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>B</kbd> ) as required. Touchdown speed is 150 m/s.
</li>Use wheel brakes ( <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> ) on rollout until you come to a halt.
</ul>
