<h1>SpaceXpanse Challenges: 2</h1>
<p><b>You are piloting a Delta-glider from low Earth orbit to rendezvous with a space station orbiting the moon.</b></p>
<p>The challenge is completed as soon as you dock with the Luna-OB1 lunar orbital station.
Similar to Challenge 1, mission success is measured by the amount of fuel left in the tank.</p>

<p>You will have to plan your transfer orbit carefully to be as fuel-efficient as possible.
The arrival at the moon and lunar orbit insertion should be planned so that a minimum of Delta-V is required for matching the orbital plane of the lunar orbital station. Approach, rendezvous and docking at Luna-OB1 should of course also be performed with minimal fuel expenditure.</p>

<p>To randomize the challenge a bit, the start time of the scenario is set to the current time, so you may have to rethink you ejection and arrival times.
<p>Good luck!</p>
