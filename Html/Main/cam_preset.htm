<h1>Camera preset views</h1>

<p>SpaceXpanse provides an easy method to store and recall camera modes in a preset list. Select the <i>Preset</i> tab in the Camera dialog. Any predefined camera positions stored with the current scenario are listed here. To activate a mode, double-click it in the list, or select the mode and click <i>Recall</i>.</p>

<p>To add the current camera mode and position to the list, simply click <i>Add</i>. This will generate a new entry with a short description in the list. To delete a preset view, select it and click <i>Delete</i>. To delete the whole list, click <i>Clear</i>.</p>

<p>Each entry remembers its track mode, position and field of view. The preset list is a good way to prepare a set of camera angles beforehand (for example to follow a launch) and then activate them quickly without having to adjust the positions manually. The preset list is stored together with the simulation state, so it can be shared via the scenario file.</p>
