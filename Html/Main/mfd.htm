<h1>Multifunctional display modes</h1>

<p>Multifunctional displays (or MFDs) are used in the cockpits of most military aircraft and mod-ern airliners. They combine the function of a variety of traditional instruments in a compact format, and in combination with computerised avionics data processing present the pilot with situation-dependent relevant data.</p>

<p>In space flight, providing the pilot with information appropriate to the current flight regime is even more critical, and the Space Shuttle makes extensive use of MFD displays. SpaceXpanse uses the MFD paradigm in a general and extendable way to provide flight data independent of ves-sel type.</p>

<p>An MFD is essentially a square computer display (e.g an LCD screen) and a set of input controls (usually push buttons ar-ranged around the screen). The specific layout can vary, but the functionality is the same. The picture shows the MFD representation for the generic cockpit view mode which is available for all ves-sel types. Up to two MFDs can be dis-played in this mode. Vessels which sup-port customised 2-D instrument panels or 3-D virtual cockpits may use a different number of MFD screens. In generic mode, the displays are superimposed di-rectly onto the 3-D scenery, representing for example a projection onto the pane of a HUD display in front of the pilot.</p>

<p>In the centre of the MFD is the data display. The 12 buttons along the left and right edge are mode-dependent function buttons. Their labels may change according to the current operation modus of the instrument. The three buttons along the bottom edge are static and mode-independent.</p>

<p>The MFDs can be operated either by left-clicking with the mouse on the buttons, or via the keyboard. All MFD keyboard functions are <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd>-key combinations, where the left and right <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> keys operate the left and right MFD, respectively. For instrument panels with more than two MFD displays, only two can be operated with the keyboard; the others are limited to mouse control.</p>

<p><b>Turning the MFD on and off</b></p>

<p>The <i>PWR</i> button activates and deactivates the MFD display. Key-board shortcut is <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">Esc</kbd>. In generic view mode, turning off the MFD also hides the buttons (except the power button, so it can be turned on again).</p>

<p><b>Mode selection</b></p>

<p>The <i>SEL</i> button activates the mode selection screen. Key-board shortcut is <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd>. Each MFD mode provides information for a different navigation or avionics problem (orbital parameters, surface parameters, docking and landing aids, etc.) For a full list of default modes see the following sections in this chapter. Additional modes may be available via addons.
The display shows the available modes in the display area, one mode next to each function button. To select a mode, simply click the corresponding button. For selection with the keyboard, move the selection indicator (green box) to the desired mode by pressing <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd>, then press <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">Enter</kbd> to select.
If there are more modes than can be displayed in a single page, pressing <i>SEL</i> (or <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd>) repeatedly will page through all mode screens. Pressing <i>SEL</i> on the last mode screen will return to the last MFD mode.</p>

<p><b>Function buttons</b></p>

<p>The function of the buttons to the left and right of the display depends on the current MFD mode, and their labels will change accordingly. Check the descriptions of the individual MFD modes below for the button functions of standard MFD modes. For addon modes, consult the accompanying documentation. In some cases the buttons may act as switches, where each press executes a specific function. In other cases it may be necessary to press down a key continuously to adjust a parameter.
Function buttons can also be activated with <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd>-key combinations. Pressing the <i>MNU</i> button on the bottom edge of the screen will switch into menu mode (key-board shortcut is <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd>), where a short description of each function button is displayed, together with the associated keyboard key. Pressing <i>MNU</i> again (or pressing a function button) will restore the display.
In generic view mode, and in most in-strument panels in SpaceXpanse the MFDs have 12 function buttons, but in principle this could vary. If an MFD mode has de-fines more functions than can be as-signed to the buttons, then pressing <i>MNU</i> repeatedly will page through the available sets of functions.</p>
