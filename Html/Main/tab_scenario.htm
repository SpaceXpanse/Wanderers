<p>
From this page you can select between different simulation startup scenarios. Scenarios are arranged in a folder structure. Folders are marked with yellow folder icons and can be opened and closed by double-clicking. Scenarios are marked with red "delta-glider" icons. When you select a scenario, a brief description will appear in the box next to the list. You can launch the selected scenario by double-clicking it, or by pressing the "Launch SpaceXpanse" button at the bottom of the dialog box.</p>
<p>
Whenever you exit a simulation, SpaceXpanse creates a special <i>(Current state)</i> scenario containing the exit status of your last simulation. You can continue your simulation at the point where you left it by launching this scenario.</p>
<p>
If you want to preserve your current exit status for later use, press the <i>Save current ...</i> button. This opens a dialog box for saving the current status scenario under a different name.</p>
<p>
During a simulation, you can save at any time by pressing Ctrl-S. This will create a new scenario in the <i>Quicksave</i> folder. Quicksave scenarios have the same name as the original scenario, followed by a 4-digit counter.</p>
<p>
You can delete all scenarios in the Quicksave folder by pressing the <i>Clear quicksaves</i> button.</p>
<p>
If you want your simulation to be paused on startup, check the <i>Start paused</i> box. Inside the simulation, you can always switch between pause/resume by pressing Ctrl-P.</p>
