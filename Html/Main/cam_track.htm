<h1>Camera track mode</h1>
<p>Use the <i>Track</i> tab in the camera dialog to adjust camera movement around a target object in external view modes (the track settings have no effect in cockpit mode). You can select between three frames of reference to attach the track camera to a target:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Movable target-relative</b>: The camera moves in the target frame of reference. It will retain its position relative to the target unless rotated manually. For example, if you use this mode to look at a planet, the camera will rotate together with the planet, and always show the same hemisphere, while the celestial background appears to revolve around the observer. The manual rotation keys rotate the camera in longitudinal and latitudinal directions.</li>
<li><b>Movable absolute direction</b>: As in target-relative mode, the camera moves in the target frame of reference (longitude and latitude), but it will retain a constant absolute direction, even if the target rotates.</li>
<li><b>Movable global frame</b>: The camera moves in the absolute frame of reference, which in SpaceXpanse is defined as the ecliptical frame (ecliptic and equinox of J2000.0).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There are two further track modes which cannot be rotated manually but instead define the camera position in terms of an additional source object:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Target from ...</b>: The camera is positioned so that the specified source object is located behind the observer, while looking towards the target.</li>
<li><b>Target to ...</b>: The camera is positioned so that the specified source object is located behind the target object.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In both modes, manual rotation is disabled, but the camera can still be moved in and out with <kbd class="ctrl">PgUp</kbd><sub><i>cursor</i></sub> and <kbd class="ctrl">PgDn</kbd><sub><i>cursor</i></sub>.</p>
