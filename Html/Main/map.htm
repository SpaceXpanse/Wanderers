<h1>Map window</h1>

<p>The Map window displays a global map of a celestial body, including surface bases, navigation transmitter positions and custom markers.
It also shows spacecraft and natural satellites orbiting the body.</p>

<p>The Map window can be opened from the main menu, or with <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd>. It can be resized as required.</p>

<p>By default, it displays the celestial body orbited by the focus vessel. You can switch to a different planet by using the <i>Body</i> list.
The list works hierarchically. From the current body, you can switch to its parent or any of its child bodies.</p>

<p>You can zoom in and out with the <i>Zoom</i> buttons.</p>

<p>Two mouse modes are available. In <i>Pan</i> mode, the map can be panned by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the mouse.
In <i>Select</i> mode, clicking the map with the left mouse button selects the closest object.</p>

<p>You can also select objects by typing their name into the <i>Find</i> box. Searches can be limited to specific object types.</p>

<p>Clicking <i>Auto-center selection</i> automatically pans the map to center the selected object.</p>

<p>For most selected objects, you can get more detailed information by clicking the <i>Info</i> button. This will open the
<a href="objinfo.htm">Object Info</a> dialog when available.</p>

<p>You can configure the map display by clicking the <i>Options</i> button. This will open a dialog that allows to enable or disable
various map elements, including orbit and terminator visualisation.</p>
