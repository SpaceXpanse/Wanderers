<h1>Camera field of view</h1>
<p>The camera <i>field of view</i> determines the aperture of the camera. A large field of view shows a large portion of the scene at small magnification, while a small field zooms in to a small area at large magnification.</p>

<p>SpaceXpanse defines the field of view as the <i>vertical</i> aperture of the simulation window (the angle between the top and bottom edge of the window).</p>

<p>You can adjust the field of view by using the <i>FoV</i> tab in the camera dialog box. You can either click on one of the buttons selecting a value in 10&deg; steps, or move the slider, or enter a numerical value. Valid entries are in the range from 10&deg; to 90&deg;.</p>

<p>To change the field of view without opening the camera dialog, use <kbd>Z</kbd> to zoom in and <kbd>X</kbd> to zoom out. You can also use <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> to zoom in and out in steps of 10&deg;.</p>

<p>The current field of view (FoV) is shown in the information block in the top left corner of the simulation window.</p>
