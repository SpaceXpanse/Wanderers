TransX V3.14.1 for Open SpaceXpanse

TransX V3.14.1
--------------
This is a derived version of TransX that has been included on Open SpaceXpanse. It is a fork from the original TransX 3.13.2 with backports from version V2014.04.26 using only MIT sources and contains no new features.

As some components are not MIT licensed they are not included in this fork, for example Auto-Min™, Auto-Center™ and ModuleMessaging functions are not present in this version.


Description & License
---------------------
This is a complex SpaceXpanse Navigation tool. It is also Beta software - it may yet have a few undiscovered bugs, and probably a new version without them will come along in a few weeks.

Installing
----------

Copy the enclosed dll file into the modules/plugin directory of your SpaceXpanse installation. Select the module on the Modules tab of the SpaceXpanse Launchpad, and activate it.


To start the module, either select the MFD from the onscreen menu, or use Shift-J to select it.



Use
---

A manual for this beta software does not yet exist. But hopefully most of you will be aware of the previous version of TransX. Here are the major changes.


A trip is now divided into multiple STAGES. You start off with just one stage.

To create more stages, first select a Target. The Target is always the first variable in the variable set. Then press the FWD button to create a new stage, and move into it.

FWD and BCK move your viewpoint between the stages you've created, and create a new stage if that's possible.

SW locks/unlocks the graph, whilst allowing you to move the variable selection as before.

Each stage has a PLAN associated with it. The MFD will normally auto-select the best plan for you, (although it is possible to change it if you have to). The plan is designed to help you plan your course through the stage.

Each Stage has three views. The first one isn't used often.
The second view contains an overall view of the stage, and has some generic variables to adjust.

The third view contains the variables associated with the currently selected plan. These change depending on which plan you select. It may sometimes also contain a different graph from view 2.

The graphs will largely be familiar to you if you've used TransX before. There are two differences.

The green orbit in a graph is now not always your ship, but can also be ANY type of trajectory that's been passed on from the previous stage.

There is one new graph type in the Slingshot plan in view 3. The yellow line represents your planned point of closest approach, and the green line your current one. Match the two together to get a perfect slingshot.

The easiest way to align them is to use prograde autopilot and linear manoevreing thrusters, whilst at a considerable distance from the planet.


Inheriting plan (EXE button):
----------------------------

If you have a couple of ships in the general vicinity of one another and one has a full TransX plan, you can transfer the plan to the other ship. Go into the other ship, click Back to prior to stage 1 and it will say "inherit plan". Click the "++" to choose the ship that already has the plan. Click EXE to transfer the plan to the ship you're in. (info from Flytandem)


Slingshots
----------

To create a slingshot,
1. Select your slingshot planet as a target, and move Forward to create a new stage.
2. Select 'Escape' as a target, and move forward again to create a new stage.

Move to view 3, and you will find TransX has created a plan for you to point the slingshot wherever you like. It's quite possible that the initial parameters require you to go below the planet's surface. Change the parameters until you're not going below the surface (Pe / Pl. Rad  is greater than 1), and you're going the way you want to.

If you then go back to the slingshot planet, you'll see your slingshot plan in yellow. Select view 3 for a graph to target it precisely.


New Features/Hacks:
------------------

By dgatsoulis:
-Added "Edge On" Graphic projection. 
An additional graph projection rotated 90° wrt the ecliptic. 
-Changed the function of Scale to View: Target.
Now when no target has been selected the view zooms in to the Major Body of the stage.
-Manoeuvre mode Target View:
A slightly bigger "X" in the crosshair view. No more "where the heck is that green little x?"
-Color of planet orbits and atmospheres changed to a lighter shade of blue.
Easier to see especially for YT videos.
-2 TransX MFDs for the price of one!
In addition to the transx.dll you get a second one named transx2.dll. The second transx uses a different color scheme (red).
In addition to the cool "TransX's evil twin" look, you get all the functionality mentioned above. It allows you to setup a completely independent TransX plan and both plans get saved in your scenario. Very handy for advanced mission planning , where you'd normally need a surrogate ship.


By Enjo:
-TransX exposes DV and Time to burn in both views: Escape Plan and Manoeuvre.
-The hypotetical line of nodes, which results from changing plane velocity, is now drawn as a dashed grey line, while the solid line is the reference line of nodes between source and target bodies.
Any questions - post in the addons section of the SpaceXpanse forum.

Happy Orbiting!
